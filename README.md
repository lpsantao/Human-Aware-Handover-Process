# Graphs for collaborative robotics: flexible task simulation and control

Most of the tasks performed by robots can be discretized in granular operations, facilitating the planning and management process of a task, and allowing for the exploitation of joining simple commands instead of programming complex ones. Given this, the Graphs for Collaborative Robotics project aims to simulate the completion of a task, generating automatically a graph composed by the respective operations. This graph should encapsulate the different operation sequences that can be performed, having as input a series of parameters of the process.
